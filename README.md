greatest common factor of 457896342434 and 32415312 using the Euclidean algorithm is 
2
execution time 0.00012339999999966267
greatest common factor of 457896342434 and 32415312 using the GCD function is 
2
execution time 1.71445310000000006312

as we can see for large number the euclidean algorithm is way faster
but for smaller number inputs:
for input:
> 74 22
> output:
```
74 22

8 6
6 2
greatest common factor of 74 and 22 using the Euclidean algorithm is 
2
execution time 0.00004029999999843881 seconds
greatest common factor of 74 and 22 using the GCD function is 
2
execution time 0.00000530000000154018 seconds
